<h2> Summary: </h2> 
<p>
Perspectives is a new approach to help clients securely identify Internet servers in 
order to avoid "man-in-the-middle" attacks.  
Perspectives is simple and cheap compared to existing approaches
because it automatically builds a robust database of network identities using lightweight network probing
by "network notaries" located in multiple vantage points across the Internet.

<h2> Description: </h2>

<p>
When you use a "secure" protocol like SSL or SSH to communicate on the Internet, 
your communication is vulnerable to a "man-in-the-middle" attack unless you
are able to identify the remote server in a secure manner.  One way to do this is to 
have the server participate in a "Public Key Infrastructure" (PKI) and buy a
certificate from a certificate authority like VeriSign.  
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, PKI's can be expensive and cumbersome to operate, leading
to widespread use of a simple and cheap "Trust-on-first-use" mechanism commonly associated 
with SSH and HTTPS with self-signed certificates.  Unfortunately, this comes at the cost
of security. 
For example, here are some familiar warnings from OpenSSH and Firefox: 
</p>
<table> 
<tr>
<td>
<pre>

The authenticity of host 'host.domain.com (192.168.74.49)' 
can't be established.  RSA key fingerprint is 
07:fd:fb:9b:03:a2:b4:e8:b3:c9:0f:0b:db:43:1c:1a.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

</pre>
<p>  </p>
<pre>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now 
(man-in-the-middle attack)!  It is also possible that the 
DSA host key has just been changed.  The fingerprint for 
the DSA key sent by the remote host is
4c:68:03:d4:5c:58:a6:1d:bd:17:13:84:14:48:ba:99.
Please contact your system administrator.

</pre>

</td>

</table> 

<p>
Few users bother to verify the correctness of the key manually (hey, we're 
lazy by nature!), but Perspectives provides a simple "no effort" way to get
significantly more information about whether a key is correct for that 
destination.  A client can automatically make a secure connection to 
one of several publicly available "network notary servers" located around the world.  
These servers tell the client:
</p>
<ol>
<li> What key does the server see for host.domain.com right now? </li>
<li> What keys has the server seen in the past for host.domain.com ? </li>
</ol>
<p>
The replies from the network notaries can go a long way toward either providing the 
user with confidence that the key it received is valid, or
that a real threat of a "man in the middle" attack exists.  
</p>
<p>
The end result is that instead of having applications issue bland warnings, which users often ignore,
the application can either skip the warning if notary data indicates the the key is valid,
or give a very stern warning in the rare cases when an attack appears to be in progress.  
</p>
<p> 
This same approach can also be used as a second layer of protection to validate
a website certificates that your browser trusts  because they appear to be signed
by a valid Certificate Authority (CA).  Perspectives could detect that a certificate
was in fact signed by a malicious CA, since it would identify that the CA-signed
certificate is different from the certificate currently in use at the website.
</p> 
<h2> Try it Out </h2> 
<p>
We have a network notary implementation actively running on the 
<a href="http://www.datapository.net/tb/"> RON/IRIS Testbed </a>.  
</p>
<p> To try it out you can: 
<ul> 
<li> Query the notary servers in real-time using our 
<a href="https://www.networknotary.org"> Notary Web Interface 
</a> </li>
<li> Use our <a href="firefox.html"> Firefox extension </a> to verify untrusted HTTPS certificates 
and to double-check certificates already trusted by your browser. </li> 
</p> 
</ul> 

<h2> Perspectives &amp; Privacy </h2> 

<p> <b> Notary Server Privacy Policy: </b>  All notary servers adhere to a strict 
policy of <b> never recording client IP addresses, period</b>.  
The Perspectives project and its software will only contact Notary servers
that follow this privacy policy.  Your privacy is important to us.
</p> 
<p> Both the Firefox and OpenSSH clients let you configure the scenarios
when the client should contact Notaries.  In fact, you can set the preferences of the Firefox client
to ask permission each time before contacting notaries.  We plan to improve
these privacy features in the future and welcome suggestions. 
</p> 
<h2> Perspectives Notary Server  </h2> 

<p> Our research group operates a set of four publicly available notary server 
using the <a href="http://www.datapository.net/tb/"> RON/IRIS Testbed </a>. 
The current <a href="http_notary_list.txt"> http_notary_list.txt </a> describes the actively
running notaries and their public keys.  The Firefox client is configured to use 
these notaries by default. </p>
<p> 

<p> It is quite easy to run your own notary if you have a Unix-based server.  You can access the source
code and install instructions at github:</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.github.com/danwent/Perspectives-Server"> Perspectives-Server </a> 
</p> 
<p> We welcome contributions to fix bugs or add new functionality. </p> 
<p> An older version of the server code (cited in our  <a href="perspectives_usenix08.pdf"> paper</a>) is still 
available at gitorious: <a href="http://gitorious.org/perspectives-notary-server"> perspectives-notary-server </a>.  
</p> 


<p>Building the software requires cmake and is documented
in the README file. </p>

<h2> Frequently Asked Questions: </h2> 
<p><b>Q:</b> Is my computer insecure if I do not install Perspectives?
</p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, you will be safe if you simply go along with Firefox's default 
suggestion and refuse to connection to any websites that show Security Errors. 
Perspectives aims to make a better trade-off between security 
and useability with respect to these Security Errors by distinguishing between the
frequent false positives and the rare (but serious) attack scenarios.  
If you aren't familiar enough with Internet security to know the difference
between a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority and a self-signed 
certificate, Perspectives may not be a good match for you.  Hopefully in the 
future we will be able to work with browser makers like Mozilla and Microsoft
to integrate Perspectives-like functionality into the normal browser experience.
</p><p>
<p><b>Q:</b> But what if an attacker takes over all paths to the destination?
</p>
<p><b>A:</b> There are two answers to that.  
Please see our <a href="perspectives_usenix08.pdf"> 
academic paper </a> for a detailed security analysis.
</p><p>
 1) Perspectives actually keeps a record of the keys used by a service
 over time.  Thus, even if a powerful adversary is able to take over
 the whole Internet (scenario L_server in the paper), clients can still
 detect the key as suspicious because the key has recently changed.  If
 the attacker is able to compromise all paths for a long time, then you
 are in trouble, but then again such a powerful adversary could also fool
 the so-called "verification procedures" of many certificate
 authorities, which often consist of a one-time email verification.
</p><p>
 2) Even though a powerful adversary can defeat the system, it makes
 man-in-the-middle attacks much harder.  Today an attacker must only be
 on the path between you and the destination, which isn't very hard.
 Think about an open wireless network, or the recent DNS attacks which
 compromise a targeted DNS resolver.  Being on all links is much
 harder, and in the end security is nothing but making an attack
 harder.

</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Does Perspectives prevent ''phishing'' attacks, when the user
clicks on a link for or is otherwise directed to a DNS address other than the
one they intended to reach?</p> 
<p><b>A:</b> No.  Perspectives extends your browser's basic SSL authentication
mechinisms, which validate that the browser is securely communicating with the
server identified in the URL bar. It cannot tell you if that URL is trustworthy
or not.  For example, if you click on an email with the link
https://www.good.com.evil.com/login it will not detect that that this website
may be posing as good.com.  You must enter in https://www.good.com/login in order
to be protected.  </p> 
<a name="firewall"/>
<p><b>Q:</b> I get a red icon and a message that perspectives failed 
every time the extension contacts notaries. What is going on??
</p>
<p><b>A:</b> The most likely cause is that you are accessing the Internet
through a proxy or firewall that is preventing Perspectives from reaching
the notaries. Currently, we query notaries over HTTP using either port 80
or port 8080.  
</p> 
<p><b>Q:</b> What about services in "private" (RFC 1918) space?
</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Unfortunately, we can't do much to monitor the keys used
by these services, since our notary servers cannot reach them.  Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> How do the recently announced 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/"> 
MD5 attack on SSL certificates </a> affect Perspectives?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> The good news is that
using Perspectives to check all SSL certificates can help detect such attacks.
Also, the MD5 weaknesses described in the paper do not compromise the security
of Perspectives.  See our <a href="md5.html" >md5 page</a> for details.  
</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> I visited a website that uses a blacklisted debian certificate 
( <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166"> more info </a> ) 
but Perspectives said it was secure, what gives? 
<p><b>A:</b> 
Detecting such certificates is not the goal of
Perspectives (there are already other fine extensions like 
<a href="http://codefromthe70s.org/sslblacklist.aspx">SSLBlacklist</a> that 
can help you).  Perspectives plays a role that is similar to a
certificate authority: avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks by
attempting to determine if an SSL certificate (i.e., a public key)
received by the browser is the actual certificate in use by the
visited website.   Perspectives does not do anything to protect you
against a poorly run website where the administrator uses an insecure
key pair (in the limit, the website admin could publish the private
key, totally undermining security).
