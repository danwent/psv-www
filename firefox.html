Perspectives : Mozilla Firefox Extension 
</h1>

<p><span style="color: #f00">Update 1-30-2011:</span> 
A new version of the Perspectives notary server is available (written totally in python).  
<a href="http://www.github.com/danwent/Perspectives-Server"> Check it out! </a> . 
</p> 
<p><span style="color: #f00">Update 1-30-2011:</span> A proof-of-concept Chrome extension
for Perspectives is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lnppfgdnjafeikakadfopejdpglpiahn"> available</a> (Warning: for experimental use only, Chrome development help is welcomed) 
</p> 
<p><span style="color: #f00">Update 11-7-2010:</span> Version 4.0 of the Perspectives Extension is available: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/7974/">Install Now</a>.  See <a href="https://github.com/danwent/Perspectives/wiki/">our wiki</a> to learn what is new and how you can help.
</p>
<h2> Overview </h2> 
<p> We have developed an extension to the popular Firefox browser that 
contacts network notaries whenever your browser connects an HTTPS website.  
<p> For an overview of how Perspectives works, see our <a href="index.html"> main page </a>. 
<p>The extension provides two primary benefits: </p>
<ol> 
<li> If you connect to a website with an untrusted (e.g.,self-signed certificate)*, Firefox 
will give you a very nasty security error and force you to manually install
an exception.  Perspectives can detect whether a self-signed 
certificate is valid, and <b> automatically overrides the annoying 
security error page </b> if it is safe to do so. </li> 
<li> It is possible that an attacker may trick one of the many Certificate
Authorities trusted by Firefox into incorrectly issuing a certificate for a
trusted website.  Perspectives can also detect this attack and will warn
you if things look suspicious.  
</li> 
</ol> 
<p> * The same is true for HTTPS sites with certificates that contain
mismatched domain names (e.g., www.gmail.com uses a certificate for 
mail.google.com) or certificates that are expired.</p>

<h2> Installation </h2>
<p> Note: All software on this page is provided "as-is", without warranty of 
any kind.  In no event shall the authors or Carnegie Mellon be liable for
any claim arising from use of this software. </p> 
 <center> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/7974/"> Install Perspectives</a> </center> 
 </p> 
 <ul>
 <li> See the list of all <a href="#knownissues"> known issues </a> below. 
 </li> 
 <li> By default Firefox blocks installation with a warning at the 
      top of your window.  You must override that warning.  </li> 
 <li> This extension works only with <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">
      Firefox 3.0 </a> or newer.  </li>
 <li>The source code is <a href="#source">freely available</a>. </li>
 </ul> 
  
<h2> Using the Extension </h2> 
<p> 
The easiest way to see what the notary client extension is doing is to use the
info box it places in the lower right-hand corner of the browser window.  The
icon tells you whether the certificate has been notarized, and you can request
to see the details of each server response. Double-clicking on this info 
box provides more detailed notary data and opens the preferences menu.
</p>
<p>
By default, Perspectives only queries for self-signed certificate or certificates
deemed invalid by Firefox.  To experiment more with Perspectives, you can change 
your preferences to query for all HTTPS connections.  
Preferences also 
let you control a security level that determines the criteria used by 
Perspectives to deem a certificate valid or invalid.  
</p>
<p>
Once Perspectives has used notary data to deem a certificate valid,
that certificate is cached locally as "trusted". You can configured 
Perspectives to cache these certificates either permanently or just for
the current instance of the browser (default).  
</p>
<p> 
Perspectives uses automatic updates to help push bug fixes, feature 
enhancements, and new notary configuration data.  If you experience problems,
please make sure you have the latest version by going to Tool &gt; Add-ons,
clicking "Find Updates", and installing the update if one is available. 
</p>

<a name="knownissues" /> 
<h2> Known Issues: </h2> 
<ol> 
<li> If your local network uses a <b>proxy or firewall</b> to access the Internet, 
it may prevent Perspectives from reaching notaries.  As a result, all sites will
fail verification (<a href="index.html#firewall">more details</a>).  </li>
<a name="nossl" /> 
<li> If going to a website with a self signed certificate causes a small error dialog to pop-up
in front of a blank page, instead of showing a full error page, Firefox may be misconfigured 
in a way that prevents Perspectives from working.  To check, type "about:config" (no quotes)
into the browser URL bar.  Click past Firefox's warning, and then type 'browser.xul.error_pages.enabled'
in the 'Filter' textbox at the top of the page.  If the 'Value' column shows 'false' for this 
setting, double click the text 'false' to change it to 'true'.  'true' is the default setting for 
Firefox 3, but some users have reported that their browser was set incorrectly.  
</li> 
</ul> 
<li> Firefox extension APIs changed significantly between Firefox 2
and Firefox 3.  The current code works ONLY with Firefox 3.  The Firefox 2 code
is no longer supported. </li> 
<li> Our code to override the Firefox security warning page for self-signed,
mismatched, and expired certs is not perfect.  Sometimes you will see the 
warning flash before our code overrides it.  </li> 
</ol> 

<a name="source"/> 
<h2> Source </h2> 

<p> The Perspectives Firefox Extension code is now available on GitHub: 
<ul> 
<li> <a href="http://github.com/danwent/Perspectives"> Perspectives GitHub Home </a></li>  
<li> <a href="http://github.com/danwent/Perspectives/archives/master"> Download Latest Source </a> (may be unstable) </li> 
<li> <a href="http://github.com/danwent/Perspectives/downloads"> Development / Beta Builds </a> (may be unstable) </li> 
</ul> 

<p> Now that Perspectives is written completely in javascript, it should be 
easy to play with the source code yourself.  The source code contains 
all required source, images, etc and includes a simple Makefile to package
an XPI file.  We welcome contributions, just send us a patch!
